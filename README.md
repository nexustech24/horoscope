## Horoscope Lyrics
This program uses the following zodiac signs and their horoscopes as described in the song:

- **Aquarius**
  > There's travel in your future\nWhen your tongue freezes to the back of a speeding bus\nFill that void in your pathetic life\nBy playing whack-a-mole 17 hours a day

- **Pisces**
  > Try to avoid any Virgos or Leos with the ebola virus\nYou are the true Lord of the dance\nNo matter what those idiots at work say

... *(truncated for brevity)*
