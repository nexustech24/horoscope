## Horoscope Lyrics
This program uses the following zodiac signs and their horoscopes as described in the song:

- **Aquarius**
  > There's travel in your future  
  > When your tongue freezes to the back of a speeding bus  
  > Fill that void in your pathetic life  
  > By playing whack-a-mole 17 hours a day

- **Pisces**
  > Try to avoid any Virgos or Leos with the ebola virus  
  > You are the true Lord of the dance  
  > No matter what those idiots at work say

- **Aries**
  > The look on your face will be priceless  
  > When you find that 40-pound watermelon in your colon  
  > Trade toothbrushes with an albino dwarf, then give a hickey to Meryl Streep

- **Taurus**
  > You will never find true happiness  
  > What you gonna do, cry about it?  
  > The stars predict tomorrow you'll wake up  
  > Do a bunch of stuff and then go back to sleep

- **Gemini**
  > Your birthday party will be ruined  
  > Once again by your explosive flatulence  
  > Your love life will run into trouble  
  > When your fiancÃ© hurls a javelin through your chest

- **Cancer**
  > The position of Jupiter says that  
  > You should spend the rest of the week face down in the mud  
  > Try not to shove a roll of duct tape up your nose while taking your driver's test

- **Leo**
  > Now is not a good time to photocopy your butt  
  > And staple it to your boss's face, oh no  
  > Eat a bucket of tuna-flavored pudding  
  > Then wash it down with a gallon of Strawberry Quik

- **Virgo**
  > All Virgos are extremely friendly and intelligent, except for you  
  > Expect a big surprise today  
  > When you wind up with your head impaled upon a stick

- **Libra**
  > A big promotion is just around  
  > The corner for someone much more talented than you  
  > Laughter is the very best medicine  
  > Remember that when your appendix bursts next week

- **Scorpio**
  > Get ready for an unexpected trip  
  > When you fall screaming from an open window  
  > Work a little bit harder on improving your low self-esteem, you stupid freak

- **Sagittarius**
  > All your friends are laughing behind your back (kill them)  
  > Take down all those naked pictures of  
  > Ernest Borgnine you've got hanging in your den

- **Capricorn**
  > The stars say that you're an exciting and wonderful person  
  > But, you know they're lying  
  > If I were you, I'd lock my doors and windows  
  > And never, never, never, never, never leave my house again
